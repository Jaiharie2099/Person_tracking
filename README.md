# Person_tracking
This is for tracking the movement of a person in public via image processing and is used for social distancing
Run the following in the terminal : 
python object_tracking_social_distancing.py --prototxt frozen_inference_graph.pb --model graph.pbtxt --video vtest.avi
And also have a video file in the same directory called vtest.avi to make it work
